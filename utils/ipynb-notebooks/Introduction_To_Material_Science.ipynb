    "One of the most exciting applications of machine learning in the recent time is it's application to material science domain. DeepChem helps in development and application of machine learning to solid-state systems. As a starting point of applying machine learning to material science domain, DeepChem provides material science datasets as part of the MoleculeNet suite of datasets, data featurizers and implementation of popular machine learning algorithms specific to material science domain. This tutorial serves as an introduction of using DeepChem for machine learning related tasks in material science domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, experimental research were used to find and characterize new materials. But traditional methods have high limitations by constraints of required resources and equipments. Material science is one of the booming areas where machine learning is making new in-roads. The discovery of new material properties holds key to lot of problems like climate change, development of new semi-conducting materials etc. DeepChem acts as a toolbox for using machine learning in material science.\n",
